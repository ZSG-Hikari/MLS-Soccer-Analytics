# MLS Player Archetypes & Anomaly Detection

This repo showcases a soccer analytics project using MLS player data to:
- compare offensive vs defensive production,
- discover offensive player archetypes with clustering, and
- flag outlier players who over/underperform relative to simple physical-trait baselines.

## What to look at first
- **Project analysis (RMarkdown):** `analysis/MLSPlayers_Analysis.Rmd`
- **Cleaned dataset:** `data/MLS_combined_data_cleaned.csv`
- **Key visuals:** `outputs/figures/`

## Reproduce
1. Open the RMarkdown: `analysis/MLSPlayers_Analysis.Rmd`
2. Ensure required R packages are installed (see package calls in the Rmd)
3. Knit / run sections to regenerate outputs.

## Notes
- The included dataset is the cleaned working dataset used for analysis.
